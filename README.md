Discord TicketBot
---
## Description & Features
- This is a simple ticket bot for discord servers. It allows users to create tickets and have a private conversation with the staff.
- It can be used in either Channel mode where each ticket is its own channel, or in Thread mode where there is a single channel which adds private threads per ticket.
- It has a web interface to look through all the closed tickets and see the conversations.

### TODO's:
- [ ] Add Discord Auth to the web interface for listing all tickets.
- [ ] Add a wiki page for the setup instructions.
